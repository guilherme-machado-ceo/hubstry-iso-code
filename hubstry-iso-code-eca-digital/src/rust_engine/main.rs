    // Placeholder for semantic parsing and compliance rule application
    // Further development will involve:
    // 1. Defining data structures for ISO codes and rules.
    // 2. Implementing a parser for the custom syntax (e.g., using a crate like `nom` or `pest`).
    // 3. Developing a rule engine to apply compliance checks.
    // 4. Integrating with external data sources for up-to-date regulations.
